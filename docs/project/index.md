# Sprints — Group Algorithm Project

![Three Sprints](https://i.imgur.com/egzptkm.png)

These sprints help you build strong habits: write clear solutions, test them carefully, and use results to explain what works best (and when).

!!! info "Why we do this"
    In programming, “works once” isn’t enough. You need solutions that are correct, understandable, and that still behave well when the input gets big. 

## Rules (for all sprints)

| Item | Rule |
|---|---|
| Group | 3–4 students (same group for all sprints) |
| Points | Sprint 1: 8, Sprint 2: 10, Sprint 3: 12 |
| Bonus | +2 points for 1st place, +1 point for 2nd and 3rd place |
| Bonus is based on | The fastest overall results in the benchmark |

## Sprint pages

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-rocket-launch-outline: **Sprint 1**  
  Build and compare sorting and searching algorithms, then write a short report with your findings.  
  [Open →](sprint-1.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

- :material-hammer-wrench: **Sprint 2**  
  This page will be added when the time comes. For now, it’s “still compiling”… patiently.  
  [Open →](sprint-2.md){ .md-button }

- :material-trophy-outline: **Sprint 3**  
  Coming later in the course. We promise it’s not an infinite loop; it just needs one more run.  
  [Open →](sprint-3.md){ .md-button }

</div>

## What you submit (each sprint)
- Your code (zip or GitHub link).
- A short report (3–5 pages, PDF): what you built, how you tested it, and what you learned.


> A marathon is run one step at a time; the same is true for good software: small, correct steps add up to big results.
