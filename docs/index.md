# Data Structures & Algorithms (Java)

Welcome. This site contains lecture notes, slides, and practice tasks for the course.

!!! info "Quick links"
    - Start here: [Foundations](foundations/index.md)
    - Course project: [Project overview](project/index.md)
    - Reading list: [Literature](literature/index.md)

## How to use this site
- Use the top menu to jump between the 4 blocks.
- In each lecture page you’ll find two sections: **Slides** (PDF) and **Practice tasks** (problems to solve).
- Before labs/exercises, skim the lecture page and try the first practice tasks.

## Course blocks
### 1) Foundations
- [Overview](foundations/index.md)
- [Algorithm fundamentals](foundations/algorithm-fundamentals/index.md)
- [Algorithm analysis](foundations/algorithm-analysis/index.md)

### 2) Linear structures
- [Overview](linear/index.md)
- [Arrays & linked lists](linear/arrays-linkedlists/index.md)
- [Stacks & queues](linear/stacks-queues/index.md)

### 3) Core techniques
- [Overview](techniques/index.md)
- [Searching & sorting](techniques/searching-sorting/index.md)
- [Recursion](techniques/recursion/index.md)

### 4) Non-linear structures
- [Overview](nonlinear/index.md)
- [Trees](nonlinear/trees/index.md)
- [Graphs](nonlinear/graphs/index.md)

## Project (3 sprints)
The course project is split into three sprints with clear deliverables.

- [Project overview](project/index.md)
- [Sprint 1](project/sprint-1.md)
- [Sprint 2](project/sprint-2.md)
- [Sprint 3](project/sprint-3.md)

## How to succeed here
This course rewards steady work more than last‑minute effort.

- Keep a small notebook (digital or paper) of ideas, mistakes, and patterns you notice.
- When you get stuck, write down what you tried and what failed—then ask a precise question.
- Aim for understanding first, speed later; clean solutions come from clear thinking.

!!! note "A good week"
    Read the lecture notes → solve a few tasks → review your solution → only then look at model answers.
