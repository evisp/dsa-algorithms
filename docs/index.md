# Data Structures & Algorithms

![DSA Algorithms banner](https://i.imgur.com/xoLA5Z1.png){ width="100%" }

Algorithms and data structures help you write programs that stay correct and fast as the input gets bigger. They teach you how to store data well and how to solve problems step by step, instead of guessing.

*Even in the era of intelligent systems*, these fundamentals matter, probably more than ever: they help you check results, understand trade‑offs, and build solutions you can explain and trust. 

!!! info "Quick links"
    - Start here: [Foundations](foundations/index.md)
    - Course project: [Project overview](project/index.md)
    - Reading list: [Literature](literature/index.md)

## How to use this site
- Use the top menu to jump between the 4 blocks.
- Each lecture page has **Slides** (PDF) and **Practice tasks**.
- Before class, skim the lecture page and try 1-2 tasks.

## Course blocks

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-school-outline: **Foundations**  
  What an algorithm is, how to describe steps clearly, and how to reason about solutions.  
  [Open →](foundations/index.md)

- :material-vector-line: **Linear structures**  
  Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues—core building blocks you’ll use everywhere.  
  [Open →](linear/index.md)

- :material-lightbulb-on-outline: **Core techniques**  
  Searching, sorting, recursion—patterns that keep returning in different problems.  
  [Open →](techniques/index.md)

- :material-graph-outline: **Non-linear structures**  
  Trees and graphs, plus fundamental traversal ideas.  
  [Open →](nonlinear/index.md)

## Project

<div class="grid" markdown>

<div class="card" markdown style="grid-column: 1 / -1">

:material-rocket-launch-outline: **Course project (3 sprints)**  
A longer task broken into three sprints with clear deliverables and regular feedback.

[Sprint 1 →](project/sprint-1.md) ·
[Sprint 2 →](project/sprint-2.md) ·
[Sprint 3 →](project/sprint-3.md)

## How to succeed here
This course rewards steady work more than last‑minute effort.

- Keep a small notebook (digital or paper) of ideas, mistakes, and patterns you notice.
- When you get stuck, write down what you tried and what failed—then ask a precise question.
- Aim for understanding first, speed later; clean solutions come from clear thinking.

!!! note "A good week"
    Read the lecture notes → solve a few tasks → review your solution → only then look at model answers.
