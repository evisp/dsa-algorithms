# Foundations

This block sets the baseline for the rest of the course: how to describe algorithms clearly, reason about correctness, and estimate performance.

## What you should get from this block
- Write precise algorithm steps (before coding).
- Explain why an algorithm is correct (what must always be true while it runs).
- Estimate time and space costs and compare alternatives.

!!! note "How to study"
    Read the lecture notes first, then do a small set of practice tasks until you can explain your solution out loud. 

## Lectures
- [Algorithm fundamentals](algorithm-fundamentals/index.md)  
- [Algorithm analysis](algorithm-analysis/index.md)  


## Practice tasks (recommended routine)
1. Solve 2–3 tasks without looking at notes.
2. Write a short “why it works” explanation (2–5 sentences).
3. Only then check hints / model solutions.

## Before moving on
You’re ready for the next block when you can:

- Choose a data structure and justify the choice in one sentence.
- Give a Big-O estimate for a simple loop/nested loop/recursion.
- Spot obvious inefficiencies (extra passes, unnecessary copying, repeated work).

> Strong programmers don't memorize solutions - they build tools for thinking.
